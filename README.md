Inspiriation

We want to help disabled people who cannot use their body to interact with the world. Therefore we build a brain machine interface to control the motion of a robot. 

What it does 

It measures electric potentials of the ocular muscles to control the eye movement of Roboy. 

How we built it 

Using Zeo, Unity game engine, Roboy, Arduino

Challenges we ran into 

Signal from EMG is mostly too noisy to extract reliable data. Hardware incompatibility and get all the libraries to work.

What we learned

Using Nerf gun; defending our castle

Whats next for Mind Control

Take over the world -> WORLD DOMINATION

Built With

ros ubuntu python c++ c libserial arduino unity
