## Inspiriation

We want to help disabled people who cannot use their body to interact with the world. Therefore we build a brain machine interface to control the motion of a robot. 

## What it does 

It measures electric potentials of the ocular muscles to control the eye movement of Roboy. 

## Challenges we ran into 

Signal from EMG is mostly too noisy to extract reliable data. Hardware incompatibility and get all the libraries to work.

## What we learned

Using Nerf gun; defending our castle

## Whats next for Mind Control

Take over the world -> WORLD DOMINATION
